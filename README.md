# DiFF-RF: forest of random partitioning trees for point-wise and collective anomaly detection
![](/fig/DiFF-RF.jpg)
This code is a simple implementation for the DiFF-RF algorithm described in this [draft paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16801), a semi-supervised approach for detecting point-wise or collective anomalies or outliers given a dataset of 'normal' instances. It implements a distance measure to a centroid and a frequency of visit mechanism at leaf level to build point-wise and collective anomaly scores. It solves a drawback identified in the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm and outperforms in general IF and other state of the art methods in anomaly detection on a large set of diversified application datasets.


This code is derived from the one provided by Xiao Han as an implemention of the Isolation Forest algorithm available at [github.com/xhan0909](https://github.com/xhan0909)


## Requirements
It supports python3.5+

No extra requirement is needed apart numpy.

## Installation
    $ sudo python3  setup.py install

    (or $python3 setup.py install --user)


## Usage

A running example exploiting 'donnuts' data is given in file testDiFF_RF_Donnuts.py

The API documentation (html Ã r pdf) is described in the file documentation/DiFF-RF-API.(html/pdf)
(generated using $ pdoc3 DiFF_RF.py --html --force)

Typical usage (close to sklearn api) is as follows:

    # Creation of the data structure
    diff_rf = DiFF_TreeEnsemble(sample_size=sample_size, n_trees=ntrees)
    # fit the DiFF-RF with (normal) data: X_train, a nD numpy array whose dimensions should be (n_obs, n_features), n_jobs : the number of process
    diff_rf.fit(X_train, n_jobs=8)
    # Get the anomaly scores for test data X_test
    point_wise_scores, visiting_frequency_scores, collective_scores = diff_rf.anomaly_score(X_test,alpha=alpha0)

### Launching the test code (requires matplotlib and sklearn)
    $ python3 -i testDiFF_RF_Donuts.py

### creating an instance of the donut dataset (normal data) and the anomaly clusters (red and green clusters)
    >>> createDonutData(contamin=0)

### Creating and evaluating DiFF-RF
    >>> computeDiFF_RF(ntrees=512, sample_size=32)

### Some of the outputs are saved on disk
Data is saved in the *PKL* subdirectory
Figures are saved in the *FIG* subdirectory
